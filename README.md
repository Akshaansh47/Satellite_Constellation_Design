# LEO-PNT Satellite Constellation Design
A comprehensive Python execution, designing and analyzing Low Earth Orbit Position, Navigation, and Timing (LEO-PNT) satellite constellations.

## Constellation Design

- Walker constellation pattern generation (default: 6 planes Ã— 11 satellites) 
- Configurable orbital parameters (altitude, inclination, plane spacing)
- Real-time satellite position calculations using Keplerian orbital mechanics
- Support for custom constellation architectures

## Performance Analysis

- Coverage Analysis: Global coverage metrics with customizable grid resolution
- GDOP Calculations: Geometric Dilution of Precision for positioning accuracy
- Link Budget: RF communication analysis with path loss and margins
- Operational Metrics: Orbital decay, station-keeping requirements, collision risk

## Comprehensive Visualizations

- Ground Track Plot: 2D satellite positions with orbital plane color coding
- Coverage Heatmap: Global visibility map showing satellite availability
- 3D Globe Visualization: Earth sphere with satellites, continents, and orbital paths
- Timeline Analysis: 24-hour constellation performance evolution

## Mission Planning

- Deployment cost estimation
- Annual operational expenses
- Technology refresh cycle analysis
- Risk assessment metrics
